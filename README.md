  **Summary of Iron Man (2008)**
Iron Man is a superhero film that marks the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The movie follows Tony Stark, a brilliant and wealthy inventor, and the CEO of Stark Industries, a weapons manufacturing company. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate his latest weapon, Tony is captured by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. During his captivity, he is severely injured by shrapnel lodged near his heart, and his life is saved by an electromagnet created by a fellow captive, Yinsen.

**Main Character**
1. Tony Stark / Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr.)

2. Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges)
The former business partner of Tony's father, Howard Stark, and the company's second-in-command at Stark Industries. Stane is a cunning and manipulative figure who turns against Tony and becomes the film's main antagonist, eventually assuming the identity of Iron Monger.

5. Yinsen (played by Shaun Toub)
